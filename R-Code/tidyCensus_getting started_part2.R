## ----Loading Tidy Census ACS Data---------------------------------------------
# For this example, we are going to look at Poverty
# To calculate income to poverty, you divide a person or family's total 
# income before taxes by the federally established poverty threshold that 
# corresponds to their household size; if the result is less than 1, then 
# their income is considered below the poverty line.
# official documentation on this data is at 
# https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/poverty/guidance/poverty-measures.html



#Display all the variable in the 2024 1 year ACS and open a tab to view the info
ACS1_2024_variables <- load_variables(2024, "acs1", cache = TRUE)

#name, label, concept and lowest level of geography available are displayed.
# this table is searchable
#search for the word Poverty and we find  there are two variables of interest

# B05010_001 total number in the estimate
# B05010_002 total number with a ratio value below 1, by definition in poverty

# Now that we have two variables to work with, we want to retrieve them from 
# The US Census using a package called TidyCensus

# Save the results of this in data frame which I am calling something like poverty_df

#Example looking at ACS1 data, remove the survey = "acs1" to use acs5
